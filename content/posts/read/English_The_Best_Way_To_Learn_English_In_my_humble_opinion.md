## WHAT YOU NEED

1）Time: 

1 hour per day (30 minutes will work as well). Monday through Friday.

2）Tools:

A notebook and a pen to write down new vocabulary each day.

3）literature:

A English song, a English book, a English television show.

4) internet connection

Which I'm pretty sure you have because you're reading the blog. 



## THE PLAN

### Monday

Mondays are for reading.

**30~40 minutes**

- Read your book.  //(if you having a little trouble understanding the book, please get the book in your own language  as well, you can read one chapter in English , and then read the next chapter in your own language and flip back and forth.) 

- Read the news.

- Read simple.Wikipedia.com.

- Be sure to write down some new vocabulary words in your notebook with their definitions.

Please do those three things for 30~40 minutes.

while you're doing those things, you should write new vocabulary words into your notebook along with a short definition of them.

**The rest of your time**

- Read part of your book out loud.

- Write out some passages.

- Listen to the audio of your book.



### Tuesday 

Tuesday are for writing.

**30~40 minutes**

- Write about yesterday. //(so that you can practice writing in the past tense.)

- Write about tomorrow. //(so that you can practice writing in the future tense.)

- Leave comments on YouTube.

- Write down likes and dislikes about your book,song or TV show.

- Write a summary of your recent reading. //(5 to 10 sentences.)

- Be sure to write down some new vocabulary words in your notebook with their definitions.

Please do those things for 30~40 minutes.

**The rest of your time**

- Read over your writing.

- Put your writing into Google translate.

- Read your English sentence out loud.



### Wednesday  

Wednesday are for listening.

**30~40 minutes**

- Watch your television show in English.

- Listen to your song a few minutes.

- Watch a few YouTube videos.

- Listen to your audiobook of your book. //(if you have.) 

**The rest of your time**

- Read about your television show on Wikipedia.

- Write a little bit about the show.

- Write about how your songs make you feel.

- Say some of the lines from the television show.

- Sing along to your song.

- Be sure to write down some new vocabulary words in your notebook with their definitions.



### Thursday 

Thursday are for listening.

**30~40 minutes**

- Talk to a native speaker on FaceTime or Skype.

- Preply, Cambly, and Italki are great. //(the websites where you can hire a native English speaker to have a conversation with you.)

- Talk out loud to yourself. //(if you can't afford to hire someone.)

- Narrate to your life.

- Be sure to write down some new vocabulary words in your notebook with their definitions.

The fact that that you know you will be talking to a native English speaker every Thursday will actually make you work harder on Monday, Tuesday , Wednesday and Friday each week in order to get ready for that session. 

**The rest of your time**

- Listen to your song again and sing out loud.

- Read your book out loud.

- Shadow or mimic actors from TV show.



### Friday 

Friday are for vocabulary.

**60minutes**

- Study the vocabulary that you wrote in your notebok earlier in the week.

- Say the words out loud.

- Use the new words in a sentence.

you should be just be spending all of your time, the entire hour, making sure that you have all your new vocabulary memorized.



### Weekend 

- Find a new song.

- Find a new book. //(if you are done reading your book.)

- Find a new TV show. //(if you are done watching all of the episodes of the television show you were watching.)

- Take a break. //(sometimes taking a break from learning actually refresh your brain and makes you better able to learn the next week.)
